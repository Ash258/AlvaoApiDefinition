# Assign To Tester

Source: <https://doc.alvao.com/en/25/modules/alvao-am-custom-apps/applications/templates/#assign-to-tester>

This app automatically assigns a ticket to a solver from the Testers group if the ticket is in the Program Modifications service and in a status with ID 1.

To run the example, a custom field solvedInVersion of type nvarchar is assumed to be added to the tHdTicketCust table.
