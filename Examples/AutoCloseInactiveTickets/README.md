# Auto Close Inactive Tickets

Source: <https://doc.alvao.com/en/25/modules/alvao-am-custom-apps/applications/templates/#auto-close-inactive-tickets>

The resolved tickets are checked to see if they have passed the time limit for the requester to reopen the ticket (days) and have the automatic transition to the Closed status turned off. If these tickets are not closed within 14 days, they are closed automatically.
